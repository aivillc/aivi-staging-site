================================================================================
SESSION 2: NAVIGATION DROPDOWN FIX
================================================================================

USER REQUEST:
"When i hover on the 'use cases' it closes right away, not allowing me to click any of the submenu items. Make sure the user is able to click those subitems"

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
- Dropdown had mt-3 gap between button and menu
- Mouse left parent div during transition, triggering onMouseLeave
- Dropdown closed before user could click menu items

ACTIONS TAKEN:
1. Fixed Navigation Dropdown (components/Navigation.tsx)
   - Restructured dropdown container from single div to nested structure
   - Outer wrapper: has pt-3 padding to create hover "bridge" area
   - Inner wrapper: contains actual menu styling (background, border, shadow)
   - Removed gap that caused premature closing
   - Preserved all visual styling and animations
   - Maintained pointer-events-none when closed

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Old: Single div with mt-3 → gap caused mouse to leave parent
- New: Outer div with pt-3 padding + inner styled div → continuous hover area

BUILD VERIFICATION:
✓ Compiled successfully in 3.9s

DEPLOYMENT:
- Committed with message: "fix: improve Use Cases dropdown hover behavior"
- Pushed to origin/master
- Deployed to Vercel production
- URL: https://aivistagingsite-rdj1p7yv2-giorgio-mihailas-projects.vercel.app

RESULT:
✅ Dropdown now works correctly - users can hover and click submenu items

SESSION 3: CONVERSATION HISTORY FILE CREATION
================================================================================

USER REQUEST:
